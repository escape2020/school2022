    "We recommend to follow this tutorial by **executing the code cells on your local machine**, along with the tutor. Every sub-topic we will cover in this tutorial will be concluded by a few **exercises with different levels of difficulty** (*easy*, *advanced* and *hard*). The exercises will not be discussed during the course, however we provide a **sample solution** for all exercises in the **solutions folder** you can look at **after the course** and load them directly in the notebook. You can always ask for help on the exercises on the correspoding Slack channel **#d05-fri11-astropy**.   \n",

    "\n",
    "    \"The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy packages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept and structure of the package is decribed in more detail in the first [Astropy paper 2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...558A..33A). The development infrastructure\n",
    "and status of the v2.0 core package is described in the second [Astropy paper 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156..123A).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Astropy package is structured into several submodules** and we will cover (what we consider) the most important of them in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [astropy.units](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html) and in particular [astropy.units.Quantity](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.units.Quantity.html) to do astronomical calculations with units.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [astropy.coordinates](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/) and in particular the classes [SkyCoord](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.html) and [Angle](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/angles.html) to handle astronomical sky positions, coordinate systems and coordinate transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [astropy.tables](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/index.html) and the [Table](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.table.Table.html) class to handle astronomical data tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [astropy.io.fits](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/index.html) to open and write data files in [FITS format](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_documentation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. (optional) Plotting of astronomical sky images with [astropy.visualization.wcsaxes](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/wcsaxes/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the Astropy core package there is an infrastructure of  [Astropy affiliated packages](http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/) dedicated to specific fields of Astronomy or analysis tasks, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Astroplan](https://astroplan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): observation planning\n",
    "- [Reproject](http://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): reprojection of sky images\n",
    "- [Regions](http://astropy-regions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): handling of sky regions \n",
    "- [Photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): source detection and photometry\n",
