This lecture will cover both aspects: first the use of a /debugger/ to identify and fix broken code, and then the use of profiling tools to identify which parts of working code be improved for speed or memory usage.\nSlides as PDF  This browser does not support PDFs.","tags":["Day 4"],"title":"Debugging and Profiling Scientific Software","url":"https://escape2020.github.io/school2022/posts/debugging-profiling/"},{"categories":["Machine learning"],"description":"Summary The Code Several notebooks to experiment with neural networks are available here: https://github.com/escape2020/school2022/tree/main/machine-learning\n Slides  This browser does not support PDFs.
